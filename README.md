# Radhika Morabia's Todo List App

This app was built by following [Watch and Code](http://rmorabia.com). None of the code was my own! This was just a project to learn the basics of JavaScript.

Down the line, I will be going through at least one other todo list tutorial. After that, I do plan to build my own from scratch.

It'll definitely be a lot prettier than this one.
