# Radhika Morabia's Todo List App(s)

This is just another todo list app.

I have written it in multiple languages & frameworks:

- [React](http://rmorabia.com/todo) [(Source)](http://github.com/rmorabia/todo)
- [Vanilla JS](http://rmorabia.com/todo) [(Source)](http://github.com/rmorabia/todo/tree/js)

Features (across all versions) include:

- Mobile-responsive
- Random colors on every new todo
- Click to mark as done, click the X to delete a todo

React features only:

- localStorage
